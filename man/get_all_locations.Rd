get_all_locations()
}
\value{
A named list where each element is a vector of colony names for a country.
}
\description{
Retrieves a list of all locations (colonies) organized by country from the Sea Track folder.
}
\details{
The function expects the global variable \code{the$sea_track_folder} to be set, and looks for a "Locations" subfolder within it.
Each country is represented as a subdirectory within "Locations", and each colony is a subdirectory within its respective country folder.
If \code{the$sea_track_folder} is not set, the function will stop with an error message.
}

set_sea_track_folder("/path/to/sea_track")
colonies <- get_all_locations()
print(colonies)
}
}
